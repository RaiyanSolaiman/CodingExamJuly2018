Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. a way to command the computer to create and run programs via source code.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. Java Develpoment Kit composed of libraries and other files JVM uses at runtime.

What is IDE?
A. Integrated Development Environment is a software application which enables users to more easily write and debug Java programs
with a code editor, a compiler or interpreter and a debugger all under one GUI.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual studio, PyCharm, Atom, Xcode, JDeveloper, and BlueJ

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. code/text editor -> code is written in editor and is now source code -> compiler -> .class bytecode file <-> Java Libraries ->
(class loader -> bytecode verifier -> interpreter)- JVM which is hosted on the OS

what is class?
A. A class definition defines instance and class variables and methods, 
as well as specifying the interfaces the class implements and the immediate superclass of the class.

What is object?
A. The principal building blocks of object-oriented programs. 
Each object is a programming unit consisting of data ( instance variables ) and functionality ( instance methods ). 

What is the entry point of an application?
A. the main method

Why main is static?
A. This is neccesary because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made.
Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. java.lang.object

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path of classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Java interface methods are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. 
A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No, not directly.
from interface, (only one abstract) any variables declared are static final by default and should be initialized.
An Abstract class is a class that can contain abstract methods or concrete methods( methods those have body) or both.

what is Access Specifier?
A. The Java access modifiers private and protected cannot be assigned to a class. Only to constructors, methods 
and fields inside classes. Classes can only have the default (package) and public access modifier assigned to them.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object oriented programming. 
-Abstraction: hiding the internal details and describing things in simple terms. 
-Encapsulation: implement abstraction in object oriented programming, used for access restriction to a class members and methods. 
uses "private", "protected", "public" keywords.
-Polymorphism:concept where an object behaves differently in different situations. 
There are two types of polymorphism â€“ compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
-Inheritance: concept where an object is based on another object. Inheritance is the mechanism of code reuse. 
The object that is getting inherited is called superclass and the object that inherits the superclass is called subclass.
-Association:defines relationship between objects. defines multiplicity between objects.
-Aggregation: special type of association. In aggregation, objects have their own life cycle but there is an ownership.
-Composition: special case of aggregation. Composition is a more restrictive form of aggregation.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A Java package organizes Java classes into namespaces, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains. 
Classes in the same package can access each other's package-private and protected members.  
java.lang package is imported by default, no need to explicitly import it. 

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
used java, C++, SDK, ALM

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. can never occur because there is no multiple inheritance. happens because dynamic loading of classes makes implementing multiple 
classes unreasonable.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, if their argument lists 
are different. happens when number, data type, and sequence of data type parameters are changed but the rest of the code is the same.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. Use Try-catch-finially OR the 
try-with-resource approach to handle exceptions.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A.

What is a constructor ?
A.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A.

What is JVM stand for ?
A.

Is JVM platform independent?
A.

What version of java are you using?
A.

What is JAR stand for ?
A.
